# P5.js

P5.js is an open-source JavaScript library for "creating graphic and interactive experiences." It's based on the core principles of [Processing](https://github.com/processing/processing), a popular programming language for visual designers.

In this demo, JavaScript is used to calculate the position of the ball, and P5 is used to draw the ball and display it on the page (using `<canvas>`).
