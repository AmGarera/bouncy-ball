This project compares web animation techniques by recreating a simple animation (a bouncing ball) with each one. It's kind of like TodoMVC, but for web animation.

This repository is two things:

  1. A **[directory](https://github.com/sparkbox/bouncy-ball/tree/gh-pages/examples)** containing examples and documentation for each animation technique.
  2. A **[demo site](http://sparkbox.github.io/bouncy-ball/)** where you can see the animations and read the source code required to create each one.

## Project Goals
  1. **Curate** the most popular and common web-animation techniques.
  2. **Compare** the techniques interactively.
  3. **Educate** developers with basic information for each technique.

## Contributing
 For questions, ideas, or bugs, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/sparkbox/bouncy-ball/issues/new). Pull requests are even better, though you'll want to read the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/sparkbox/bouncy-ball/blob/gh-pages/contributing.md) first.
